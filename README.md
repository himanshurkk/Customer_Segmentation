## Analysis of Customer Segmentation 


# Abstract: 
> Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into people who are different from the rest of the company, such as employees, customers, suppliers and customers of other companies. Customer segmentation is based on the most important distinguishing features that divide customers into target groups. Companies also hope to gain the ability to identify who the most valuable segments are by more precisely adapting marketing materials to these segments. Customers differ, and customer segmentation is based on the division of the customer into these groups, which can all be targeted. Corporate customers believe that their marketing efforts are best served by targeting a specific, small group with messages that are relevant to that consumer and from which they buy.
